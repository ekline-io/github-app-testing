title: File Manager Overview
description: Overview and setup instructions for the File Manager project, including the new file upload feature.
---

## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It includes a comprehensive file management system with a new file upload feature.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Easily upload files using the new file upload component. This feature is designed to handle various file types and sizes efficiently.
- **File List**: View and manage uploaded files with the file list component.
- **Optimized Fonts**: Utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Setup Instructions

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Basic Setup Example

To integrate the file upload feature, ensure you have the following components set up:

```typescript
import FileUpload from './components/FileUpload';
import FileList from './components/FileList';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>File Manager</h1>
      <FileUpload />
      <FileList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This example demonstrates how to include the `FileUpload` and `FileList` components in your application to manage files effectively.
