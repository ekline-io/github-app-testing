## Component Overview

The `FileList` component is designed to display a list of uploaded files within your application. It fetches file data from an API endpoint and presents it in a tabular format, allowing users to view and download files.

The component handles loading states, error states, and provides functionality to refresh the file list.

## Props and Methods

The `FileList` component does not accept any props. It internally manages its state and lifecycle using React hooks.

### Internal State

- `files`: An array of `FileItem` objects representing the uploaded files.
- `loading`: A boolean indicating whether the file data is currently being fetched.
- `error`: A string that holds any error message encountered during the fetch operation.

### Methods

- `fetchFiles`: An asynchronous function that fetches the list of files from the `/api/upload` endpoint. It updates the `files`, `loading`, and `error` states based on the fetch result.

### Helper Functions

- `formatFileSize(bytes: number): string`: Formats the file size from bytes to a human-readable string.
- `formatDate(dateString: string): string`: Formats the date string into a more readable format.

## Usage Examples

### Displaying a List of Files

To use the `FileList` component, simply include it in your JSX. It will automatically fetch and display the list of files.

```typescript
import FileList from './components/FileList';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Uploaded Files</h1>
      <FileList />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Customizing File Display

While the `FileList` component does not accept props for customization, you can modify the component directly to change styles or add additional functionality, such as custom actions for each file.

## Component Structure

The component renders a table with the following columns:

- **Name**: The name of the file.
- **Size**: The size of the file, formatted for readability.
- **Uploaded**: The date and time when the file was uploaded.
- **Action**: Links to view or download the file.

### Error and Loading States

- **Loading**: Displays a spinner and a loading message while files are being fetched.
- **Error**: Displays an error message and a retry button if the fetch operation fails.
- **No Files**: Displays a message indicating that no files have been uploaded if the file list is empty.

The `FileList` component is a versatile tool for managing and displaying uploaded files, providing a user-friendly interface for file interaction.
