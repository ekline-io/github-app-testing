## Component Overview

The `FileUpload` component provides a user interface for uploading files via drag-and-drop or by selecting files through a file picker. It handles file selection, drag events, and displays upload progress. This component is designed to integrate seamlessly with an API endpoint for file uploads.

## Props and Methods

### Props

- `onFileUpload`: A callback function that is triggered after a successful file upload. This function can be used to refresh the file list or perform other actions upon completion of the upload.

### Methods

- `handleDragOver(e: DragEvent<HTMLDivElement>)`: Handles the drag over event to provide visual feedback when a file is dragged over the upload area.
- `handleDragLeave(e: DragEvent<HTMLDivElement>)`: Handles the drag leave event to reset the visual feedback when a file is dragged away from the upload area.
- `handleDrop(e: DragEvent<HTMLDivElement>)`: Handles the drop event to process the file(s) dropped into the upload area.
- `handleFileInputChange(e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)`: Handles the change event for the file input to process the selected file(s).
- `handleFiles(files: FileList)`: Processes the file(s) for upload, manages upload progress, and handles errors.
- `openFileSelector()`: Opens the file picker dialog for selecting files manually.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage Example

```typescript
import FileUpload from './components/FileUpload';

const App = () => {
  const handleFileUpload = () => {
    console.log('File uploaded successfully');
    // Refresh file list or perform other actions
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Upload Your Files</h1>
      <FileUpload onFileUpload={handleFileUpload} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Advanced Configuration Example

In this example, we demonstrate how to handle errors and customize the upload process further.

```typescript
import FileUpload from './components/FileUpload';

const App = () => {
  const handleFileUpload = () => {
    console.log('File uploaded successfully');
    // Additional logic after file upload
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Advanced File Upload</h1>
      <FileUpload onFileUpload={handleFileUpload} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this advanced example, you can extend the `handleFileUpload` function to include additional logic such as updating the UI or making further API calls after a successful upload.
